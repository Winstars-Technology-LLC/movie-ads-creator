## Advertisement insertion application

_Mechanism for ads insertion based on OpenCV package._

To insert ad you need to have the following:
- The logo to insert. **Preferable formats are .png, .jpg**;
- The video file for ad insertion;
- Python 3.7 to be installed.

The mechanism's main properties as follows:
- Detect stable contours in video using image threshold;
- Find stable contours among existing;
- Insert ad into detected contours;
- Extract audio track from input video and add it to the output.

To run the mechanism do the following:
- Download the repository with all consisting files:
1. From the repository, select **Clone or download**.
2. Copy the repository URL.
3. From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.
4. Write the command: ```git clone <URL>```, where URl is copied repository URL;
- Create project virtual environment: 
1. From the terminal install virtualenv package:  ```pip install virtualenv```.
2. To create virtual environment specify a path. In the local directory type the following: ```virtualenv my_venv```.
3. Activate the virtual environment by the following command: ```source my_venv/bin/activate```. 

- Install or upgrade necessary packages from requirements.txt - from the terminal window write ```pip install -r requirements.txt```;

- Install FFmpeg framework:
1. From a terminal window update the packages list by the following command: ``` sudo apt update```.
2. Install FFmpeg by typing the following command: ``` sudo apt install ffmpeg```.

- Run development server: from the terminal window move to the working directory and type: ```python app.py``` and follow the link below;

- To begin working with application press '**default**'; 

- There is an opportunity to set preferable minimum time period for appearing unique logo in video. By default each logo will appear not less than 1.5 seconds. To change time period click '**Put**' method (Update model configuration), click '**Try it out**' and set parameter contour_threshold to the desired value, after that press '**Execute**';

- There is an opportunity to set preferable minimum contour area for logo insertion. By default minimum contour area is 3000 pixels. To change contour area, click '**Put**' method (Update model configuration), click '**Try it out**' and set parameter min_area_threshold to the desired value, after that press '**Execute**';

- If you want to check current model configuration, choose '**Get**' method (Get current model configuration), and click '**Try it out**';

- To insert the ad into video choose '**POST**' method, click '**Try it out**', replace 'string' in front of 'logo_path' and 'video_path' with the logo and video path respectively, and click '**Execute**'. After execution you will see the model response "Video file has been processed." and the output video will be stored in working directory;

- To stop the application press CTRL+ะก from the terminal window.
